# evrt: Evaluation Reporting Tool for R

This is an under-development package for doing reporting from evaluation data (surveys). It takes advantage of excellent software, including gtsummary, ggplot, officer and flextable, to provide nice evaluation summaries.

As mentioned, this software is still under development but does work. Documentation is slim at present.
